Subject: Let me Help You

Hello,

Math homework is always really hard, 
I know of a website that can help you not only find the answer,
but also show you all of the steps on how to complete the problems.

My friend showed me this website last semester, and I have to say,
it's been very useful. I think I would've failed if not for it.
There's also reviews on the homepage so you know it's legit.

Put localhost:3000 in your web browser and it should load right up.

Thank me later!
